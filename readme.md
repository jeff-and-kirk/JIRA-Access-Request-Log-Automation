Access Request Initiation Logger
================================

The purpose of this automated log 
creation script is to run a JQL
each month that will provide valuable
information pertaining to who requested
access to key internal systems, if the 
access was approved and who carried out 
the request.  This log can then be part
of a full life cycle of access control 
management for our security team and to 
furnish comprehensive artifacts within an 
auditing process.
